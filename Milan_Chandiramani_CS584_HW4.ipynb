    "Goals\n",
    "The goal of HW4 is for you to get hands-on experience of utilizing pre-trained and large language model for the machine reading comprehension task. The questions are open questions and there is no fixed solution. Different data selection and processing, parameter initialization, data split strategies will lead to different predictions and results. Therefore, during the grading, the specific values in the results are not required. It is important that you focus on implementing and setting up the pipelines of applying these models to solve the tasks."

    "  ### Prompt to Chat GPT:\n",
    "  **CONTEXT** : A self-described \"modern-day feminist\", Beyoncé creates songs that are often characterized by themes of love, relationships, and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment. On stage, her dynamic, highly choreographed performances have led to critics hailing her as one of the best entertainers in contemporary popular music. Throughout a career spanning 19 years, she has sold over 118 million records as a solo artist, and a further 60 million with Destiny's Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She has won 20 Grammy Awards and is the most nominated woman in the award's history. The Recording Industry Association of America recognized her as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s decade. In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade, the Top Female Artist of the 2000s and their Artist of the Millennium in 2011. Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013 and 2014. Forbes magazine also listed her as the most powerful female musician of 2015.\n",
    "  Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine Ann \"Tina\" Knowles (née Beyincé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager. Beyoncé's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name. Beyoncé's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former member of Destiny's Child. Mathew is African-American, while Tina is of Louisiana Creole descent (with African, Native American, French, Cajun, and distant Irish and Spanish ancestry). Through her mother, Beyoncé is a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard. She was raised in a Methodist household.\n",

    "  **CONTEXT** : A self-described \"modern-day feminist\", Beyoncé creates songs that are often characterized by themes of love, relationships, and monogamy, as well as female sexuality and empowerment. On stage, her dynamic, highly choreographed performances have led to critics hailing her as one of the best entertainers in contemporary popular music. Throughout a career spanning 19 years, she has sold over 118 million records as a solo artist, and a further 60 million with Destiny's Child, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. She has won 20 Grammy Awards and is the most nominated woman in the award's history. The Recording Industry Association of America recognized her as the Top Certified Artist in America during the 2000s decade. In 2009, Billboard named her the Top Radio Songs Artist of the Decade, the Top Female Artist of the 2000s and their Artist of the Millennium in 2011. Time listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013 and 2014. Forbes magazine also listed her as the most powerful female musician of 2015.\n",
    "  Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine Ann \"Tina\" Knowles (née Beyincé), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager. Beyoncé's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name. Beyoncé's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former member of Destiny's Child. Mathew is African-American, while Tina is of Louisiana Creole descent (with African, Native American, French, Cajun, and distant Irish and Spanish ancestry). Through her mother, Beyoncé is a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard. She was raised in a Methodist household.\n",

    "\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "RoBERTa: Correct, literal extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT: Both prompts correct in content, slight differences in wording. Template 1 adds a phrase (“a tribute to”), Template 2 sticks to the literal phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini 3.0: Adds additional detail “Beyincé” (the actual maiden name). Factually correct, though a little add-on to the ground truth answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs provide more informative or elaborated answers.\n",
    "They may slightly deviate from the exact phrasing of the ground truth but are still correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the advantage of generative models in giving richer, human-readable answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "RoBERTa is strictly extractive and cannot add context or clarification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Observations from the Two Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extraction vs. Generation: RoBERTa always matches ground truth exactly but cannot elaborate. LLMs can add reasoning or context, which is sometimes beneficial (Q14) but can cause errors (Q8).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prompt Sensitivity: ChatGPT with Template 2 avoids the Q8 error by forcing grounding. Gemini seems less sensitive to prompt constraints in numeric aggregation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tradeoff Between Accuracy and Informativeness: Extractive models → precise, literal, perfect for numbers/facts. LLMs maybe flexible, can elaborate or reason, but may hallucinate without careful prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moral/Learing of the Assignment: For numeric QA tasks requiring exact answers, extractive grounding or carefully designed prompts is critical. For richer explanatory answers, LLMs are advantageous."
